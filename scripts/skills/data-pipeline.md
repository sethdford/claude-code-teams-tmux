## Data Pipeline Expertise

Apply these data engineering patterns:

### Schema Design
- Define schemas explicitly — never rely on implicit structure
- Use migrations for all schema changes (never manual ALTER TABLE)
- Add indexes for frequently queried columns
- Consider denormalization for read-heavy paths

### Data Integrity
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Implement idempotency keys for operations that could be retried
- Validate data at ingestion — reject bad data early
- Use constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY) in the database layer

### Query Patterns
- Avoid N+1 queries — use JOINs or batch loading
- Use EXPLAIN to verify query plans for complex queries
- Paginate large result sets — never SELECT * without LIMIT
- Use parameterized queries — never string concatenation for SQL

### Migration Safety
- Migrations must be reversible (include rollback steps)
- Test migrations on a copy of production data
- Add new columns as nullable, then backfill, then add NOT NULL
- Never drop columns in the same deploy as code changes

### Backpressure & Resilience
- Implement circuit breakers for external data sources
- Use dead letter queues for failed processing
- Set timeouts on all external calls
- Monitor queue depths and processing latency
